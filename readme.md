# NUnitTestsExtractor

## Attention:
If you wanna get the tests from a net461 dll you need to run the net461 version of NUnitTestsExtractor. If you wanna extract tests from a netcoreapp dll you need to run the netcoreapp version of NUnitTestsExtractor.
Else you will experience some "Could not load dll / assembly" errors.
